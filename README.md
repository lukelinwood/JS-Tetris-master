# JS-Tetris
This is a simple Tetris game made using javascript.

There is a lot of room for improvement, but the core concepts are there including the manipulation of canvas, button UI, scoring, CSS styling and smooth transitioning between mobile and desktop viewing.

# Future Developments
This could be improved upon in the following ways:
-  Advanced scoring system that rewards T-spin tricks and combos.
-  Introduction of a level system with a ramping difficulty curve.
-  More than one difficulty setting.
-  A polished grid and cleaner block design.
-  Styling of a start, pause and game over screen.
